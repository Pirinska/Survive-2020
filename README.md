# Survive-2020

Survive2020 is a game developed as a project for the module Web Technologies at Edinburgh Napier University by Iliyana Pirinska. The requirements for the project was to create a "choose-your-own-adventure" text style game with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The goal of the game is to raise awareness of what has happened during the year 2020 engagingly. Survive2020 offers customisation by adding your name and choosing an assistant who will guide you throughout your game experience.

Moreover, to create a more satisfying user experience and atmosphere, the game offers selected videos and articles connected to real-life events that the script is inspired from.
